# Assessment test

The coding exercise allows us to assess your approach to solving a problem, what you prioritise, how you communicate your thinking and how you respond to any suggestions or advice. Ultimately, its a chance for us to understand what it would be like to work with you and also a chance for you to assess if we are a good fit for you.

It is a 45-60 minute exercise where you and an Engineer work as a pair writing code to solve a problem.

Similar to when you pair with a colleague, there will be a driver and a navigator. The driver will be the one at the keyboard, whilst the navigator will be on the side making suggestions and asking questions.

You will typically play the role of driver and the Engineer will be the navigator.

If there is something you don't know, searching online is fine and encouraged.

### Solution Choice

Depending on the nature of the role you are applying for, you can create the application as either a command line application, web application or mobile application.
